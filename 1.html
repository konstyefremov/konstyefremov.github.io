      <h2>python packages</h2>
      <p>A package in Python is a program which you can use by itself, or which you can reuse in your project.
        There are lots of packages for different purposes. To perform mathematical operations, to work with databases, to built websites etc.
        You can even find a <a href="https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html">package</a> which downloads videos from Youtube.
      <p>Noncomplete list of packages can be found at <a href="https://pypi.org/">The Python Package Index</a>.
        At the moment (March 2019) there are 173,483 projects listed on the website. So, it's obvious why Python comes pre-installed with only the most essential packages.
      </p>
      <h2>pip</h2>
      <p>
        Python comes with a command line utility <code>pip</code> to manage packages. With it you can see which packages are available on your system, install new ones, remove not needed anymore.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To install a package.
        Open a command line and write <code>pip install &lt;package-name&gt;</code>. For example, a command
        <code>pip install flask</code> will install the latest version of Flask. You also can install a specific version of package. For example, a command <code>pip install flask==0.12.4</code>
        will install Flask version 0.12.4.
        </li>
        <li>
          To see which packages are available on your system, write <code>pip list</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          To remove a package, write <code>pip remove &lt;package-name&gt;</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>virtual environments</h2>
      <p>
        Most of the programmers build and maintain many projects. At the same time packages evolve. They remove some features, add anothers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now imagine (a typical) situation. A programmer built a project and shipped it to the client 2 years ago with some package.
        Since then, this package changed and his project became incompatible with the new version of the package.
        One day the client calls and asks to fix some problem with the project. If the programmer will install a new version of the package, he will need to do lots of work to
        make the project compatible with the new version of the package. But he needs to fix only some small problem.
        If he will install two versions of this package on his computer, the new will override the old one.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this problem (and some others), python provides a tool called <strong>virtual environment</strong> or <strong>venv</strong>.
        With this tool (actually a package) you can create separate environments for each project and support them independently from each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get started, you will need:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>install virtual environment package on your computer <code>pip install virtualenv</code></li>
        <li>install the package to make it easier to work with on Windows <code>pip install virtualenvwrapper-win</code></li>
        <li>
          create a new virtual environment, write <code>mkvirtualenv &lt;folder name&gt;</code><br />
          This command will copy python executables to the folder and enter the new environment.
          You will see the name of environment in brackets before the name of the current folder.
        </li>
        <li>
          to activate the environment write <code>&lt;folder-name&gt;\Scripts\activate.bat</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          to deactivate write <code>deactivate</code>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Flask is a framework for building web applications</p>
